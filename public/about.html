<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In January 2023, I made a life changing decision to pursue a dream I had nurtured for 2 years to become an expert in any aspect of computer technology. I enrolled to be trained as a full-stack software engineer at Alx Africa, a training I embarked on for 12 months.</p>

<p>I branched into software engineering from a background in medicine, having been working as a licensed veterinary medical doctor in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

<p>My drive to delve into software engineering was drawn from a dream to provide novel solutions to medical problems using technology, and to provide indigenous technological solutions to African problems so as to improve the quality of life in Africa.</p>

<p>My key areas of focus are the health, agro, finance, and education tech sectors</p>
